# Command Line Interface

See the [LibHaLo CLI example](https://github.com/arx-research/libhalo/blob/master/docs/desktop-cli.md) for more information on interfacing with HaLos via a command line interface. You will need a USB reader like the [ARC1252](https://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/342/acr1252u-usb-nfc-reader-iii-nfc-forum-certified-reader) in order to send messages to the HaLo.
