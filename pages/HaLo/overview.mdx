# Overview

Released in 2022, HaLo chips ("Hardware Locked Smart Contracts") come in a variety of form factors and offer powerful secp256k1 signing capabilities.

HaLo chips self-generate their own secp256k1 ECDSA keypairs at the point of manufacture. This keypair is designed to be non-extractable for the life of the chip. Anyone with physical possession of a HaLo chip can instruct it to generate signatures which can be used on- and off-chain to authenticate it, transfer assets, whitelist addresses or more.

HaLo's signing capabilities are the same that you would find with a digital wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). Signatures can be formatted to conform with different signing standards including [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) and [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and can easily be verified via smart contract.

## Interfaces

A HaLo can be read over NFC using the NFC Forum Type 4 Tag Standard where it provides information about its associated public keys through a NDEF URI record. NDEF URI content can typically be read by NFC enabled smartphones without the need for a dedicated application simply by tapping the chip. 

This interface and URI content are similar to what you might receive when you tap your phone to an off-the-shelf NFC tag embedded in a smart poster or business card. A single URI-type record on the HaLo contains all information including public keys for the chip. 

HaLos also offer a proprietary browser-based interface based on the credentials API and an ADPU interface that can be accessed with a dedicated mobile app or via desktop USB reader.

## Usage

On iPhone models beginning with the XS, or more recent and NFC-enabled Android smartphones, you can hold a HaLo chip to the antenna to read the NDEF URI record. On both iPhones and Androids this will read in a notification inviting the user to load a URL. On older NFC equipped iPhones like the iPhone X or 7 there is an explicit NFC scan action in the Control Center that must first be activated.

You can also use a dedicated NFC tag scanning app like [NFC Tools on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749) or [NFC Tools on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&pli=1).

The browser and NDEF interfaces for chips allows for reading and writing commands to the chips according to the [command structure](../HaLo/command). The browser interface uses the credential API which is available in most mobile browsers on NFC-enabled smartphones including Mobile Safari and Android Chrome.

If writing NDEF messages to the chip, you can either use a dedicated mobile app or [WebNFC where supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_NFC_API).
